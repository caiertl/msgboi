    A template file defines a couple of keys that translates into a Slack
    notification. Each key has a value that can be either static or use one or
    more available tags. Each tag is populated directly from the Gitlab event.

        (1) the template file content is loaded in-memory so each tag can be
        replaced to a directly related value defined at the "event" (the object
        created earlier with relevant Gitlab's event data);

        (2) the processed template content (which is a YAML-formatted document)
        is parsed to a JS object;

        (3) the JS object is stringified to a JSON document, which is then
        returned and made available here.

    The document structure follows what the Slack API expect. Roughly speaking,
    the JSON document we made is a single message attachment in Slack.

    Information on Slack's attachment structure can be found here:
    <https://api.slack.com/docs/message-attachments>

        (1) that the template file could not be found;
        (2) that the template file could not be read;
        (3) that the YAML is malformed.

    In one or more cases, an exception will be thrown.
